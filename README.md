## üìÇ Dataset Overview

The dataset includes various attributes related to laptops such as brand, technical specifications, and pricing details. Each record in the dataset represents a unique laptop model with the following features:

| Feature           | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Company`         | Manufacturer or brand of the laptop                                         |
| `TypeName`        | Type/category (e.g., Gaming, Ultrabook)                                     |
| `Inches`          | Screen size in inches                                                       |
| `ScreenResolution`| Resolution and display technology                                           |
| `Cpu`             | Processor (CPU) model                                                       |
| `Ram`             | RAM size                                                                    |
| `Memory`          | Storage capacity (HDD/SSD)                                                  |
| `Gpu`             | Graphics processor (GPU) model                                              |
| `OpSys`           | Operating system                                                            |
| `Weight`          | Weight in kilograms                                                         |
| `Price`           | Price in local currency                                                     |

## ‚úÖ Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values using imputation/removal.
   - Fix inconsistencies (e.g., typos, irregular formatting).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of individual variables.
   - **Bivariate Analysis**: Relationships like `Price vs RAM`, `Weight vs Screen Size`.
   - **Multivariate Analysis**: Interactions and dependencies among features.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Generate histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
   - Visualize trends, brand preferences, and market dynamics.

4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract new features like brand reputation or processor generation.
   - Apply dimensionality reduction (if required).

5. **Analysis & Interpretation**
   - Identify key drivers of pricing and performance.
   - Spot market trends and customer preferences.
   - Provide actionable insights for manufacturers and marketers.

6. **Documentation**
   - Clear documentation of each step: cleaning, EDA, visualization, and insights.
   - Designed to be accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.
